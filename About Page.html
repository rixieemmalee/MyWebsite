        <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Emmalee. I'm the designer/creator of this website. As a
      younger child I always loved to write. I love to write about pretty much
    everything. As I got a little older, I enjoyed it just as much as I did in
    previous years. Now, I wanted to create this website to explore new things,
    and trying out different things and I wanted to write about it and give
    you my reviews and just tips. As a school assignment we were asked to
    create a website using programs like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had no experience
    with any of these programs before this year. So, I spent as much
    time as I could writing out designs, searching for content, and to try to
    make this a workable/respondable website for you to enjoy! So..I hope you
  enjoy! </p>

<h2>About the Website</h2>
  <p>So, Like I said befoe I'm new to the programs we were asked to use to create
    our website. This experience has been a challenge, learning code is like trying
    to learn another language
    If you have any questions/concerns please contact me through my social media.
