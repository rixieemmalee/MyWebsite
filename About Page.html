        <h2>About Me</h2>
      <b><h5><p>My name is Emmalee. I'm the designer/creator of this website. As a
      younger child I always loved to write. I love to write about pretty much
    everything. As I got a little older, I enjoyed it just as much as I did in
    previous years. Now, I wanted to create this website to explore new things,
    and trying out different things and I wanted to write about it and give
    you my reviews and just tips.
    So I really hope you like it!<p><h5><b>

<h2>About the Website<h2>
  <h5><p>I wanted to design a website that would reach a variety of different
    people.
    So, It took me awhile to really think about the content that I wanted to show.
    I wanted something that had various options of thimgs to try. I picked topics
    that I really enjoy. Topics that I belived would be beneficial to anyone
    who wanted to check my website out. Even though the topics don't really
    go together, that's the whole point of my website. It's designed more as a
    blog, and blogs are centered around a "daily life" or it's more focused on
    one subject instead of four different ones. But, I wanted to give everyone
    what they are looking for in one page. So if you need last-mintue recipe
    ideas, ideas for a arts & crafts to try, lively outfit ideas, and just
    a postive message to get you through you day, it's all wrapped up in one.

    If you have any questions/concerns please contact me through my social media.
