        <img src="images/fashion1.jpg" alt="Outfit: Black & White striped shirt,
        with black jeans, and pointed toes flats." >
      </div>

    <p class=" box3">Outfit number one is one of my favorites. I highly recommend a striped shirt,
    because they can really go with anything! And you can make the dressy or casual.
  So, with this shirt I just paired it with some black jeans (which I got on sale from
  Walmart.) they are super comfy and stylish. Now for my shoes, I wanted to add something
that would spice up my outfit so I added pointed toe shoes. I also got my shoes from Walmart.
And also my watch is from Walmart, and I literally wear it all the time!


And note if you plan on getting a pair of pontied toe shoes, think to size down at least
half a size. I got a 6 (which is my normal shoe size. And they were a little bit too big.)</p>

      </div>

    <p class="box3">Outfit number two is another one of my go-to's. I paried
    yet another striped, with just a pair of blue jeggings. And to make
  it even more casual I added my new favorite shoe, my mules.I'm not entirely sure where
my shirt is from (someone gave it to me awhile ago). But, my jeggings are from Warmart. And my
shoes I got on sale from Target. My necklace I aslo got on sale at Target. </p>

  <p class="box3">Outfit number three is one of my favorite fall outfits. My sweater is from <i>American Eagle</i>. I haven't
  wore it a ton! I'm pretty sure someone gave it to me though. Next, my jeans. These are one of
  my favorite pairs of jeans, they are <i>Celebritiy Pink</i> brand from Marshalls. They are a-maz-ing!!
  And my shoes are just a light brown color to compliment the over-sized scarf. M booties are
from Marsalls also, but they are <i>The Lucky Brand</i> Even though these shoes
are a little bit pricey, they are so worth it!! My scarf is a blanket style, and it's from Cato's</p>




      <div class="box2">

      </div>

    <p class="box3">Outfit number four is one I recently started liking. someonegave me this top, but it's like a
    silky material, and I love the caged look around the neck-line. The top is from <i>Express</i> The jeans
  are from <i>The Lucky Brand</i> and so are my booties. I highly recommend <i>The Lucky Brand</i>
Even though the brand is a little expensive, it's worth the investment. This brand,
lasts forever! </p>

<p class="box3">Outfit number five. I put two of my favorite pieces of clothing together.
The yellow sweater was given to me, and I wear it with everything, legging, jeans, skirts, you
name it! I reccomend getting a sweater like this for fall. Next, my striped skirt,
I got this skirt awhile ago from GoodWill. Even though it's super thin, it's nice
that the colors are able to go with things I already have. I wore black tights
underneath, and just matched it with my black <i>Lucky Brand</i> booties.</p>

      <h2>Styling Tips</h2>
      <p> <li>The majority of the time it's extremely hard for me to find
        pants that fit properly. Most of the time I have to roll my pants
      at the ankles, so the lenghth works for me. Even though I probably should start buying petite style
    pants, but I actually now prefer just to roll the bottoms of my jeans
  which I think adds even more detail to your outfit. If you do roll your pants,
I would say pair it with flat shoes.</li></p>

<p><li>I read somewhere on the way French women decide on what shoe to wear Withouttheir outfits.
And it said that they, wear flat shoes with any garment above/at the knee. And anything
below that point they wear heels. Which Makes a lot of sense, if you're wearing a dress
that is long, wearing flats could cause the dress to drag across the floor. But, if you
wear a short shirt with heels, in my opinion wouldn't make the outfit classy, so if you
plan on wearing a shorter bottom, go with flats!</li></p>
      <h2>Shopping Tips</h2>

        <li>Always Look in the clearance or sale section of a store. You can
        almost always find something you want, at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Shop at 2nd hand or thrift store. I reccomended stores
      like this because at stores like this you have the chance
    to find really unique articles of clothing at a decent price.</li>
    <li>When it comes to shopping online you should, always sort items from
   "low to high." </li>

<p>Basic color tees are a must-have. These types of shirts, you can really do
  anything with. You can dress them up, go for a casual look, it's easy to pair with
other items.</p>
